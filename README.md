![Password-generator](Password-generator.png)

I needed to generate a password to meet a certain criteria and make sure that it is a strong password.

* When prompted with page I am able to click button to generate password

* When button is clicked I am promted to type the length of the password I want between 8-128 characters. If it is less than 8 or more than 128 characters I am promted with an error message

* After I am then prompted if I want a lower case letter, folowed by an uppercase letter, number, and special characters where i can say OK for "yes" or Cancel for "no"

* If all criterias are not met I am prompted with an alert message to follow at least one criteria.

* After everything is followed it will generate a password for you and it will be displayed in an alert and text.
